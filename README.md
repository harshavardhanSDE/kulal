# 🪈 Kulal (Pipe)

> **The Universal Reliability Layer for your Webhooks.**
> *Ingest. Buffer. Transform. Deliver.*

**Kulal** is a self-hosted, single-binary infrastructure tool that acts as a "Smart Pipe" between chaotic third-party integrations (Stripe, GitHub, Slack) and your backend.

It absorbs traffic spikes, guarantees delivery via persistent queuing, and normalizes data before it ever hits your server.

## 💥 The Problem

Building webhook integrations is painful:

1. **Downtime:** If your server is down for 5 minutes, you lose Stripe payment events forever.
2. **Spikes:** A viral marketing campaign triggers 10k webhooks/sec, crashing your database.
3. **Chaos:** Every integration sends data in a different weird format.

## 🛡️ The Kulal Solution

Run `kulal` in front of your API. It accepts the request immediately, saves it to disk, and reliably pushes it to you at a pace you can handle.

**Think of it as NGINX + Kafka + JQ, but just one binary.**
